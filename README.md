Legends of Aetherfall is a Java-based turn-based RPG developed as part of an 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project. It demonstrates core OOP concepts such as inheritance,
encapsulation, polymorphism, and method overriding through a structured class hierarchy. 
The game includes character creation, battle mechanics,
and special abilities, making it both an engaging project and a practical application of OOP principles.
